        <p style="margin: 2%; line-height: 130%;">From the mighty stretches of the Karakorams in the North to the vast alluvial delta of the Indus River in the South, Pakistan remains a land of high adventure and nature. Trekking, mountaineering, white water rafting, wild boar hunting, mountain and desert jeep safaris, camel and yak safaris, trout fishing and bird watching, are a few activities, which entice the adventure and nature lovers to Pakistan.
            Pakistan is endowed with a rich and varied flora and fauna. High Himalayas, Karakoram and the Hindukush ranges with their alpine meadows and permanent snow line, coniferous forests down the sub-mountain scrub, the vast Indus plain merging into the great desert, the coast line and wetlands, all offer a remarkably rich variety of vegetation and associated wildlife including avifauna, both endemic and migratory. Ten of 18 mammalian orders are represented in Pakistan with species ranging from the world's smallest surviving mammals, the Mediterranean Pigmy Shrew, to the largest mammal ever known; the blue whale.</p>

        <p style="margin: 2%; line-height: 130%;">Pakistan is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 metres and probably as many peaks above 6,000 m. There is no count of the peaks above 5,000 and 4,000 m. Five of the 14 highest independent peaks in the world (the eight-thousanders) are in Pakistan (four of which lie in the surroundings of Concordia; the confluence of Baltoro Glacier and Godwin Austen Glacier).
            Most of the highest peaks in Pakistan lie in the Karakoram mountain range (which lies almost entirely in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of  Pakistan, and is considered to be a part of the greater Himalayan range) but some peaks above 7,000 m are included in the Himalayan and Hindu Kushranges. The list is an incomplete list of mountains in Pakistan. There are many named and unnamed peaks in Pakistan that are currently not included in this list. The list also includes many peaks that are not usually classed as independent mountains, but instead are considered subpeaks of other mountains, due to having low topographic prominence.
Most of the highest mountains in Pakistan are located in the Karakoram range (the highest of which is K2, globally ranked 2nd, 8611m), some high mountains are in Himalaya (the highest of which is Nanga Parbat, globally ranked 9th, 8126 m) and Hindu Kush (the highest of which is Tirich Mir, globally ranked 33rd, 7708 m).

        <p style="margin: 2%; line-height: 130%;">In the heart of Lahore, Pakistan, where history, culture, and architecture merge, lies the splendid Wazir Khan Mosque. 
        My journey to this vibrant and revered place was a vivid tapestry of colors, culture, and spiritual enlightenment.</p>
        
            <p style="margin: 2%; line-height: 130%;">The sun was gently kissing the ancient city of Lahore as I approached the Wazir Khan Mosque. The call to prayer echoed through the narrow streets, creating an atmosphere of serenity and anticipation. As I entered the mosque's courtyard, I was greeted by a symphony of colors and the intricate artistry of Mughal architecture.
            
            The Wazir Khan Mosque, built in the 17th century during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan, is a masterpiece of tile work and frescoes. Its façade is adorned with a kaleidoscope of Persian-style blue and white tiles, featuring intricate geometric patterns and floral designs. The colors, still vibrant after centuries, painted a vivid picture of the Mughal era's opulence.</p>
